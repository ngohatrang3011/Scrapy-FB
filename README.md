# Facebook Crawling Scripts
# Introduction
Hello! This repository contains code for crawling comments, reactions from posts/photos, and users' profiles from social media platforms using Scrapy and Selenium. While the current implementation works, there's room for improvement in terms of efficiency and scalability.

# Scripts
- fb_photos.py: Crawls photos from Facebook.
- fb_posts.py: Retrieves posts from Facebook.
- mfb_reaction.py: Collects reactions on Facebook posts.
- profile.py: Crawls users' public profiles.
